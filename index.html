      <b>International Business Machines Corporation</b> (using the
      <a href="#">trademark</a> IBM), nicknamed Big Blue,<sup>[6]</sup> is an
      American multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New
      York, and present in over 175 countries. <sub>[7][8]</sub> It is a
      publicly traded company and one of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones
      Industrial Average.[a][9][10] IBM is the largest industrial research
      organization in the world, with 19 research facilities across a dozen
      countries; for 29 consecutive years, from 1993 to 2021, it held the record
      for most annual U.S. patents generated by a business.

      IBM was founded in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company
      (CTR), a holding company of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring
      systems. It was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924 and soon
      became the leading manufacturer of punch-card tabulating systems. During
      the 1960s and 1970s, the IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360 and
      its successors, was the world's dominant computing platform, with the
      company producing 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of
      computers worldwide.[11] Embracing both business and scientific computing,
      System/360 was the first family of computers designed to cover a complete
      range of applications from small to large.[12]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>IBM originated with several technological innovations developed and commercialized in the late 19th century. Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885;[19] Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);[20] Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine (1889);[21] and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record workers' arrival and departure times on a paper tape (1889).[22] On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York.[1][23] The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Canada.[24]</p>
